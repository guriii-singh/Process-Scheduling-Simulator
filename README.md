## 📄 Overview

This project is a web-based simulator for various CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to visualize and understand how different scheduling techniques manage process execution in a system. The supported algorithms include Round Robin (RR), First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN).

### 🛠️ Features

- **🎮 Interactive Interface**: Add processes with custom attributes such as arrival time and burst time.
- **🌀 Multiple Scheduling Algorithms**: Choose between Round Robin, FCFS, SJF, and SRTN.
- **📊 Dynamic Gantt Chart**: Visualize the scheduling sequence of processes on a Gantt chart.
- **📋 Ready Queue Visualization**: View the order of processes in the ready queue as they are scheduled.
- **⏱️ Timestamp Tracking**: See the exact times when processes start and complete execution.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality, including the implementation of scheduling algorithms.


## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Add Processes**: Enter the arrival time and burst time for each process you want to simulate.
2. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select the CPU scheduling algorithm you want to visualize (RR, FCFS, SJF, SRTN).
3. **Run the Simulation**: Watch the Gantt chart dynamically update as the processes are scheduled.
4. **Analyze the Output**: View the order of processes and track their execution times.
